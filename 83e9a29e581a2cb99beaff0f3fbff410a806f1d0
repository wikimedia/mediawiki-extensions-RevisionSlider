      "message": "Good thinking and it works - although a bit hacky ;-).\n\nIt really seems we have to reapply the focus when the update of the diff is done. Maybe we can do this somehow directly. \n\nFollowing the code we have:\n\nSliderView.refreshDiffView -\u003e DiffPage.refresh\n\nLooking at the latter brings us to Line 40 in DiffPage.js where the jQuery ajax request is executed to get the new diff. The request itself is asynchronous but $.ajax returns a jqXHR object that we can use to e.g. set callback functions for a finished request ( \\o/ ). See for example line 47.\n\nIf we pass this \"lastRequest\" jqXHR object down to the buildTabbingRulesOnKeyUp method we could set another \"then\"-callback to reset the focus directly after the request and the updates are finished.\n\nLuckily all methods in the chain do not return anything yet, so this should be easily possibly ( and also might be helpful for other things in the future ) :-).",
