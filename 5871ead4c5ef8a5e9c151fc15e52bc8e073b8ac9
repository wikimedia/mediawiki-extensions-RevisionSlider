So trivial here means containing both a marker of section edit, and some edit summary text?\nThat might be fine but then when looking at what the function actually checked it turns out that non-trivial comment is the one containing anything else than latin letters or numbers (e.g. two words in comment make it already non-trivial).",

This remark about a possible not needed use of \u0027i\u0027 applies to several other regex matches in this class, so it might be a thing to decide on in another patch, though.\n\nDon\u0027t know if this is important here but does \\w or \\W also catch non-latin characters?
