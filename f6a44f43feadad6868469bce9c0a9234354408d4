Making possibly hundreds if thousands of CSS classes (each only for a very single element) that have nothing to do with style does not seem right. At least it seems quite unlikely that at some point there are different styles applied for the 2nd popup, different for 35th etc.\n\nMaybe we would rather re-think the need of this particular id, and if possible just ditch it? I will have a look.",
