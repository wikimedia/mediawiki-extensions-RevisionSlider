So I guess the 2016 way would be margin-top: calc(71px - 0.5em) but then probably there are still lots of silly browsers around.\nI\u0027m ok with the current solution if that works in all the browsers that we want to support.",

      "message": "According to the internets using calc would only be a problem in IE 8 and lower, which are not versions we support afaik, so this could actually work.\n\nBut then I am not sure do we really want/need to have vertically-centered with 100% accuracy. The text was not centered vertically at all. So I thought I\u0027d put it from some distance from the top edge (see PS3), and this would hopefully look quite good on all screens. Or am I missing some edge cases?",
