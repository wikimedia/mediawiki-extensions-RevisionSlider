It might not be that harmful,though. Still I believe you might have meant mw-revslider-revisions-container here\n\nAlso, I personally would be more happy to see $foo.length \u003d\u003d\u003d 0 than !$foo.length in those checks but I am not going to require this. The way it is now is still fine, I think",
